# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is a water app.
This app is a simple water tracker that help you with counting liters of water that you have drunk during the day.

In this project I added 8 extra glasses and increased from drinking 2 liters to 4 liters of water and localstorage for theme and glasses.

Inspiration to this project I got from udemy course created by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
